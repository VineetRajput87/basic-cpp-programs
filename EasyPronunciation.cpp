// Q.:- Words that contain many consecutive consonants, like "schtschurowskia", are generally considered somewhat hard to pronounce.
// We say that a word is hard to pronounce if it contains 4 or more consonants in a row; otherwise it is easy to pronounce. For example, "apple" and "polish" are easy to pronounce, but "schtschurowskia" is hard to pronounce.
// You are given a string SS consisting of NN lowercase Latin characters. Determine whether it is easy to pronounce or not based on the rule above â€” print YES if it is easy to pronounce and NO otherwise.
// For the purposes of this problem, the vowels are the characters {a,e,i,o,u} and the consonants are the other 21 characters.
