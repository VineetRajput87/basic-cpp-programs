// Q.:- There is a 10Ã—10 grid with rows numbered 1 to 10 from top to bottom, and columns 1 to 10 from left to right. Each cell is identified by a pair (r,c) which means that the cell is located at row r and column c.
// If Vineet's current location is (a,b), then in one move Vineet can go to (c,d) if both of the following are satisfied:
// 1. a!=c
// 2. b!=d
// Determine the minimum number of moves required to go from (s_x,s_y) to (e_x,e_y) .
