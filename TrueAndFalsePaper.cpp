// Q.:- Alice wrote an exam containing NN true or false questions (i.e. questions whose answer is either true or false). Each question is worth 1 mark and there is no negative marking in the examination. Alice scored K marks out of N.
//     Bob wrote the same exam but he marked each and every
//     question as the opposite of what Alice did, i.e, for
//     whichever questions Alice marked true, Bob marked false and
//     for whichever questions Alice marked false, Bob marked true.
//     Determine the score of Bob.
